## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is a project made to predict users who churn from the Sparkify platform.

From a log file of user activities, I did some analysis, treatments and tested some ML models to make this prediction

This project uses Python 3 and the following libraries:

datetime
pandas
pyspark.sql
pyspark.ml

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 files:
**Sparkify.ipynb** - notebook with all the code and analysis made.
**mini_sparkify_event_data.json** - json file with the logs of Sparkify usage.
